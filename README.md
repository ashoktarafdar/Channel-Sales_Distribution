# Channel-Sales_Distribution
#PROBLEM Statement: Suppose you are the distributer of FMCG Company and distribute variety of FMCG product such as Fresh Product, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergent Paper, and Delicatessen. Existing delivery system deliver goods in the morning time for five days. The distributer wants to reduce cost of delivery and they introduced a new delivery system in evening for three days in a week.
The distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries â€” losing the distributor more money than what was being saved.
#POSSIBLE SOLUTION: One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. In other words we can say that objective is to separate or group customers based on their spending pattern.
Grouping based on annual spending on variety of products
Grouping based on different types of products
Grouping based on delivery time of the product
